        <h1>“If the voyage sounds a bit nonobjective and aloof, it is only because Lune is preoccupied with bigger existential questions. Questions such as: how should the spaces inside of a computer simulation be and exist? The coherent answer is just like any other virtual world—with stable architecture constructed from big, sturdy polygons. But Cohen’s answers are rarely coherent. In his artistic statements, VR worlds are transcendent, throbbing with visual energy, writhing and twisting around you.”
